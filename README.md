This repository contains the code which we have developed for allowning SMEs to monitor the powers consumed by their electronics.

Pi.py can be deployed on a raspberry pi to send data to the InfluxDB server.

In our solution based on plotly, dash and influxdb, the user will firstly generate the specifications for different robots, and then a wide range of interactive visualizations for different machines for machine power, machine cost, and total cost based on the energy time and total energy getting dynamically from sensors. If a threshold is met, the alert email is generated for further operation.
